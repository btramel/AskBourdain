**In the future**: I may compile list of attractions and restaurants Anthony Bourdain recommended on his travels, hard-code them into an array, and then filter the Google Maps results to only include Bourdain-approved spots. 

The project is hosted on Netlify. Feel free to <a href="https://askbourdain.netlify.app/">mess around with it</a> before I run out of monthly Travel Advisor API calls!
