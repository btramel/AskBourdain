**Languages**: ReactJS, Material UI (CSS Framework)

**APIs**: Google Maps API, Geolocation API, Travel Advisor Places API

**Features**: search for attractions in your area (default) or any area you search for, smooth scroll, API integrations, environment variables

**In the future**: I may compile list of attractions and restaurants Anthony Bourdain recommended on his travels, hard-code them into an array, and then filter the Google Maps results to only include Bourdain-approved spots.
